# 🐛 Bug Fixes - Image Upload & Error Handling

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Image Upload Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking the upload area didn't open file picker

**Root Cause**: The `<label>` element had `for="file-input"` but the `<input>` had `ref="fileInput"` without an `id` attribute. The HTML `for` attribute needs to match the input's `id`, not the ref.

**Solution**:
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<input ref="fileInput" type="file" />
<label for="file-input">...</label>  <!-- Doesn't work! -->

<!-- After -->
<input id="file-input" ref="fileInput" type="file" />
<label for="file-input">...</label>  <!-- Works! -->
```

### 2. ❌ Drag & Drop Not Working
**Problem**: You couldn't drag an image onto the upload area

**Root Cause**: No drag-and-drop handlers were implemented

**Solution**: Added three new handlers:
- `@dragover.prevent="handleDragEnter"` - Shows visual feedback
- `@dragleave.prevent="handleDragLeave"` - Removes visual feedback
- `@drop.prevent="handleImageDrop"` - Processes dropped file

Also added visual feedback with a dragging state:
```vue
<div class="upload-area" :class="{ dragging: isDragging }">
  <p>{{ isDragging ? '📥 Drop your image here' : 'Click to upload...' }}</p>
</div>
```

### 3. ❌ Errors Not Displaying
**Problem**: When submitting text or image, if there was an error, it wasn't shown to the user

**Root Cause**: Error state from composable wasn't being synced with the component. Plus error message wasn't being set properly.

**Solution**:

**A) Made error writable in composable**:
```typescript
// Before
return {
  error: readonly(error),  // Read-only, can't modify
  ...
}

// After
return {
  error,  // Writable, can be set from component
  ...
}
```

**B) Properly handle errors in component**:
```typescript
const handleTextProblem = async () => {
  error.value = ''  // Clear previous error
  try {
    await explainProblem(...)
  } catch (err: any) {
    error.value = err?.data?.statusMessage || err?.message || 'Failed to get explanation'
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `app/pages/index.vue`

#### Image Upload Template Changes
```vue
<!-- Added id attribute -->
<input id="file-input" ... />

<!-- Added drag handlers with visual feedback -->
<label
  for="file-input"
  @dragover.prevent="handleDragEnter"
  @dragleave.prevent="handleDragLeave"
  @drop.prevent="handleImageDrop"
>
  <!-- Added dynamic text based on dragging state -->
  <p>{{ isDragging ? '📥 Drop your image here' : 'Click to upload...' }}</p>
</label>
```

#### JavaScript Changes
- Added `isDragging` state to track drag state
- Added `handleDragEnter()` function
- Added `handleDragLeave()` function
- Updated `handleImageDrop()` to process drops
- Created `processImageFile()` to share logic
- Updated `handleTextProblem()` to properly display errors
- Updated `handleImageProblem()` to properly display errors
- Added error clearing: `error.value = ''`

#### CSS Changes
Added dragging state styling:
```css
.upload-area.dragging {
  background: #bfdbfe;
  border-color: #0284c7;
  border-width: 3px;
  transform: scale(1.02);
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3);
}
```

### File: `app/composables/useMathExplainer.ts`

Changed error from readonly to writable:
```typescript
return {
  error,  // Changed from readonly(error)
  ...
}
```
